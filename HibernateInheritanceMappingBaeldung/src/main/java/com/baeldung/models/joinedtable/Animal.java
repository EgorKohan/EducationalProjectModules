/**
 * Using this strategy, each class in the hierarchy is mapped to its table.
 * The only column that repeatedly appears in all the tables is the identifier,
 * which will be used for joining them when needed.
 *
 * Let's create a superclass that uses this strategy:
 *
 * Both tables will have an animalId identifier column.
 *
 * The primary key of the Pet entity also has a foreign key constraint to the primary key of its parent entity.
 *
 * To customize this column, we can add the @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn annotation:
 *
 * The disadvantage of this inheritance mapping method is that retrieving entities requires joins between tables, which can result in lower performance for large numbers of records.
 *
 * The number of joins is higher when querying the parent class because it will join with every single related child â€” so performance is more likely to be affected the higher up the hierarchy we want to retrieve records.
